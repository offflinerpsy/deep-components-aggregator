# WARP Proxy Verification â€” 2025-10-06T23:32Z

- `wireproxy.service` is active and listening on `127.0.0.1:25345`.
- `warp-svc` tries to launch MASQUE proxy but logs `Address already in use` because `wireproxy` has already bound the port; this is expected while wireproxy front-ends the WARP tunnel.
- Direct IP: `2a03:6f02::dca8` (see `ip-direct-20251006T232524Z.txt`).
- Proxy IP via `127.0.0.1:25345`: `2a09:bac5:4e27:2705::3e3:2e` (see `ip-proxy-20251006T233112Z.txt`).
- Conclusion: outbound traffic through the configured HTTP proxy uses the WARP egress while direct traffic remains on the datacenter IP, matching the desired split.
