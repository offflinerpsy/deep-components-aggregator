Hello Mailjet Support,

Thanks for the quick response. Please find the details below:

1) Monthly sending volume

- Peaks: up to ~10,000/month during product updates or seasonal activity
- Daily peaks: typically < 300–500/day

2) Business description
We run an online aggregator of electronic components (B2B/B2C). Users search parts, view specs/availability, and place requests/orders. We send transactional notifications related to account and orders. We do not buy, rent, or scrape email lists.

Marketing / Newsletters / Bulk
- We are NOT sending marketing or newsletters at this time.
- No mailing lists; N/A for list age and opt-in URLs.
- If we ever send marketing in the future, we will use explicit consent (double opt‑in) and follow best practices.

Transactional messages
- Triggers:
  - Account registration → email verification
  - Password reset → reset link
  - Order placed → order confirmation and status updates
  - Quote/Invoice ready → notification with link to view

- Sample: Email verification
  Subject: Verify your email — Prosnab
  From: Prosnab <no-reply@prosnab.tech>
  Body (text):
  "Hello {first_name},
  Thanks for signing up at Prosnab. Please verify your email to activate your account:
  Verify link: https://prosnab.tech/verify?token=…
  If you didn’t request this, you can ignore this email."

- Sample: Order confirmation
  Subject: Order received — #{ORDER-12345}
  From: Prosnab <no-reply@prosnab.tech>
  Body (text):
  "Hello {first_name},

  Item: {MPN} / {Manufacturer}
  Quantity: {10}
  We’ll keep you updated on status. You can view details in your account."
