Admin login POST success (HTTP 302 -> /admin) without bypass
Date: 2025-10-24T10:14:47Z

HTTP/2 302
server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
location: /admin
set-cookie: deep_agg_sid=...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None

Follow-up GET /admin:
HTTP/2 200 content-length: 161316

Notes:
- Root cause was Sequelize SQLite DATE.parse expecting string and calling includes on non-string for DATETIME columns.
- Fix: select explicit attributes (exclude DATETIME) in AdminUser.findOne during login.
