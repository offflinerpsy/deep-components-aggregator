Admin login POST failure (invalid credentials) now returns clean error state
Date: 2025-10-24T09:58:41Z

HTTP/2 200
... (login page HTML)
Embedded state:
window.__APP_STATE__ = {"action":"/admin/login","errorMessage":"invalidCredentials"};

Note: Confirms previous error "date.includes is not a function" is resolved; invalid creds path behaves normally.
