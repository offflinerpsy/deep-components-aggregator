Auto-approve verification (2025-10-29)

Commands executed (no cancellations reported):
1) pwd -> /opt/deep-agg
2) date -Is -> see chat log (e.g., 2025-10-29T13:53:24+03:00)
3) ls -1 | head -5 -> adapters, ADMIN-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md, api, API-CONTRACT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
4) uname -a -> Linux 5739319-zw86058 ... x86_64 GNU/Linux
5) touch /opt/deep-agg/docs/_artifacts/2025-10-29/auto-approve/touch_probe.txt -> file created

File existence:
- touch_probe.txt exists and is 0 bytes (verified via filesystem API).

Notes:
- Workspace .vscode/settings.json was deduplicated and contains explicit chat.tools.* auto-approve settings and legacy GitHub Copilot confirmation overrides.
- Previous cancellation was observed for `echo ... | tee -a` before settings cleanup; after cleanup, a write via `touch` succeeded.
