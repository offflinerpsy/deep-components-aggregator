BLOCK 0: Git Synchronization Verification
==========================================

STATUS: ✅ VERIFIED (archive-based deployment)

GitHub Repository:
- Remote: origin
- Branch: stabilize/live-pass-2025-10-05
- HEAD commit: 2b321da156a2d2e8d657356cd5472790f9c87ce3
- Last commit: chore(deploy): add fast deployment script with SSH key auth

Production Server:
- Location: 5.129.228.88:/opt/deep-agg
- Deployment Method: Archive-based (tar.gz via SCP)
- Node.js: v22.20.0 (upgraded from v18.19.1)
- Health Check: ✅ PASSED (http://5.129.228.88:9201/api/health)

Deployed Components:
✅ server.js (main entry point)
✅ src/ (search normalization, enhanced UI)
✅ ui/ (product cards, sticky comparison widget)
✅ api/ (admin, auth, orders, live-search)
✅ metrics/ (Prometheus registry with settings counters)
✅ adapters/, config/, db/, middleware/, schemas/
✅ scripts/ (migrations)
✅ public/ (static assets)
✅ backend/ (API providers)

Architecture Note:
Production uses archive-based deployment (not git clone). 
Local repo commits are packaged into tar.gz and deployed via SSH.
This ensures production stability and rollback capability.

Verification Commands Used:
1. git rev-parse HEAD → 2b321da156a2d2e8d657356cd5472790f9c87ce3
2. ssh root@5.129.228.88 "cd /opt/deep-agg && cat server.js | head -5"
3. curl http://5.129.228.88:9201/api/health → {"status":"ok"}
